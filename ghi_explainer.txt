Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is a measure of the total irradiance of the sun on a surface parallel to the surface of the Earth at a given position. It is a combination of Direct Normal Irradiance (beam radiation) and Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (scattered light). GHI is  GHI is measured in  W/m^2 (kWh/m^2 over time). GHI values for each lat/long position are taken from NREL's NSRDB Physical Solar Model (PSM) v3. The inter-county comparisons shown in the "Commonwealth of Virginia" Map are determined using the average daily GHI for year 2020 across all lat/lon points within a county. The "heat map" for intra-county comparisons of each lat/lon point within a county is a relative measure and is the sum of all GHI timepoints for a given lat/lon point for the whole year.
