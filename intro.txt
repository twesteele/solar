This project was made possible by data from the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB), Zillow Housing Data, and EnergySage. The NSRDB was used to gather Global Horizonal Irradiance(GHI) Data from across the Commonwealth of Virginia from year 2020. The Zillow Home Value Index(ZHVI) represents the typical home price for Single Family Residential (SFR) homes and was used for the Typical Housing Price and year over year projected appreciation for an SFR in each county. The average installation cost of a 5kW solar system was determined using EnergySage.
